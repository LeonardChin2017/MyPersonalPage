        <h2>RDBMS and NoSQL: Understanding Their Differences</h2>
        <p> The comparison between RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) and NoSQL can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p> NoSQL databases excel in scalability, making them suitable for handling a large number of read-write operations and large 
            amounts of data with minimal latency. They offer flexibility in data modeling, making them ideal for situations where the 
            data model is uncertain and subject to frequent changes. NoSQL databases prioritize eventual consistency over strong consistency, 
            which is advantageous when immediate consistency is not critical and transactions are not required. Additionally, 
            NoSQL databases are well-suited for data analytics scenarios that involve handling massive amounts of data. However, 
            it's important to note that SQL-based RDBMS still possesses strengths such as a strong mathematical basis, declarative syntax, 
            and a well-known language in Structured Query Language (SQL). NoSQL is not intended to replace SQL but rather to provide an
             alternative for non-relational data scenarios.</p>
            
        <p>In this blog, we will focus on RDBMS. Examples of RDBMS include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Sqlite. SQL is the language used to 
            access and control RDBMS. Almost all RDBMS systems accept SQL instructions, although there may be slight differences in the 
            specific SQL dialect they support.</p>

        <h2>PostgreSQL vs. MySQL: Which Is Better?</h2>
        <p> If you are developing an application with a database backend, you may wonder which option to choose. For applications that 
            may scale to an enterprise level, involve complex queries, and require frequent write operations, PostgreSQL is a recommended 
            choice. On the other hand, if you are new to databases, do not anticipate significant scaling, or need a quick prototyping tool, 
            MySQL is worth considering.</p>
