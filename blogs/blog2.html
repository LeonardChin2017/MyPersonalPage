            <h1>Leading Self Program: My DISC Report</h1>
            <p class="post-date">Published on Jun 28, 2023</p>
        </div>

        <h2><u>About Leading Self Program</u></h2>
        <p>The Leading Self Program (LSP) is a program provided by Fish Camp Learning and sponsored by Continental Automotive that aims to 
          enhance the soft skills of its employees. In this program, DISC is used to assess our personality.
        </p>

        <h2><u>About DISC</u></h2>
        <p> The DISC profile traces its roots back to the early 1920s when it was introduced by psychologist William Moulton Marston. 
          Marston's model aimed to understand human behavior by identifying four primary types of behavioral expression based on a person's 
          perception of themselves in relation to their environment. Today, the DISC profile serves as a comprehensive tool for comprehending 
          behavior strengths and limitations, enhancing communication styles, recognizing the diverse needs of others, and valuing and 
          accepting individuals. It is particularly valuable for fostering effective teamwork as it enables individuals to adapt and 
          collaborate with different styles, ultimately strengthening relationships and promoting overall effectiveness in a variety of 
          settings.</p>

        <p> <b>D (Dominance):</b> Individual emphasizes on getting jobs done; goal oriented; confident.</p>
        <p> <b>I (Influence):</b> Individual emphasizes on influencing or persuading people; enthusiastic; emotional.</p>
        <p> <b>S (Steadiness):</b> Individual emphasizes on being supportive; harmonious; steady.</p>
        <p> <b>C (Compliance):</b> Individual emphasizes on quality and accuracy; careful; high standards.</p>

        <h2><u>About My DISC Report</u></h2>
        <p> Based on the DISC report, I am a Designer Style (C & D, but predominately C). As a Designer, I am a highly task-oriented individual who is sensitive to problems. People often perceive 
          Designers as prioritizing task planning and completion over considering others' feelings. I am driven and have an effective 
          problem-solving approach. However, due to my desire for tangible results, I may come across as unfeeling or distant at times. 
          My decision-making is based on facts rather than emotions, and I tend to be quiet and cautious in trusting others.</p>
        <p> Being a Designer, I excel in analytical thinking and have a high intellect as I dedicate myself exclusively to tasks. 
          I value fact-based techniques and reject quick fixes. Commitment is essential to me, and I expect others to uphold their 
          commitments as well. My competitive nature drives me to use facts strategically. Quality is of utmost importance, and I 
          firmly believe that a job should be done right or not done at all. I maintain high standards in both my work and personal life, 
          emphasizing accuracy and precision.</p>
        <p>At times, I can become too absorbed in my work and struggle to delegate tasks or accept help from others. I have a strong desire 
          to gather all the necessary facts and ensure I have comprehensive information before making decisions. While I recognize the need 
          to be more sensitive to the needs of others, I feel that taking the time to gather information leads to better decision-making, 
          even if it may be perceived as a delay by others.</p>
        <p>My motivation lies in leading groups and influencing others, whether they are associates, coworkers, or friends. I take the 
          responsibility of leadership seriously and make important decisions promptly. My confidence naturally draws others to follow my 
          lead.</p>
        <p>In social settings, I tend to avoid being the center of attention and choose my friends carefully. I approach new relationships 
          with caution and may appear skeptical of others' promises. However, once someone proves their reliability, I am willing to invest 
          more time and trust in the relationship.</p>
        <p>Others see me as a versatile individual whom they rely on to break up monotony and routine. I occasionally prefer to work 
          independently rather than within a team, reflecting my individualistic nature. Some may perceive me as restless as I tend to move 
          quickly from one task to the next.</p>
        <p>As a perfectionist, I am willing to put in the effort to achieve high-quality results. However, I am also sensitive to criticism 
          due to my meticulous approach. I gather a significant amount of information before making choices, believing that if everyone 
          processed information the same way I do, we could maintain a higher level of quality.

        <h2><u>My Strengths in Leadership</u></h2>
        <h4> INFLUENCING </h4>
        <p> <b>Adequate</b>: Leading and influencing others is something that comes easier for others, but you are willing to step up to the role 
            when no one else volunteers. You prefer an association with a strong leader who has the same goals and values that you do.</p>

        <h4> DIRECTING </h4>
        <p> <b>Main Focus</b>: Others view you as someone who gets things done, but someone who values them more for what they can do than 
          who they are. Remember that asking is better than telling.Relating to others is often as important as accomplishing the goal; 
          try to be more approachable.Take time to develop relationships and be more transparent about yourself. 
          Others see you as independent at times; they want you to be more of a team member with whom they can relate.</p>

        <h4> PROCESSING </h4>
        <p> <b>Well Developed</b>: You like to be "hands on" and are great at following through and finishing strong. Others rely on you to make a 
          system really work the way it was intended. You may have a hard time delegating at times, but you are willing to delegate when 
          a project is larger than you can handle. Others see you as loyal and caring and a real team player.</p>

        <h4> DETAILING </h4>
        <p> <b>Extreme Focus</b>: You need to live life and be more spontaneous in things you do. You tend to over analyze details to the 
          point of not doing anything at all about the situation. You tend to always be operating under the "Ready, Ready, Ready" approach. 
          Try "Ready, Aim, Fire!" Decide to do something fun and spontaneous, make a new friend or go somewhere new and exciting.</p>

        <h4> CREATING </h4>
        <p> <b>Above Average</b>: You like to use your creativity to perfect basic concepts that other team members develop. You can oversee 
          and help keep accountability in areas that others may compromise.</p>

        <h4> PERSISTING </h4>
        <p> <b>Above Average</b>: Others like working together with you because you typically do more than your share of whatever is required
          and this makes the entire team look good. You will maintain a hands-on approach and let others visibly see that you are a team player.</p>
        
        <h4> RELATING </h4>
        <p> <b>Fair</b>: You sometimes say the wrong thing or nothing at all, but you find the necessary tools to maintain good relationships.
          Try to understand more about others' styles and how they like to communicate. The DISC system should give you a better understanding in these areas.</p>
