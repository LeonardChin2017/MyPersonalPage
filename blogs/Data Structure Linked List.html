            <h1>Data Structure: Linked List</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When I joined Continental Automotive as a software developer and took on the role of Warning Feature Responsible for a newly awarded Full Digital Cluster project, I faced the challenge of designing a feature with complex requirements from the ground up. One of the key modules within this feature required performing flexible and extensive insertion and deletion of warnings during runtime. Efficient retrieval was also a concern but relatively low priority compared to the need for flexible insertion and deletion. Furthermore, I needed to consider dynamic sizing as the number of elements is unknown. To meet these demands, I chose to implement a <span style="color: red;">circular doubly linked list</span> as the underlying data structure. Its O(1) time complexity for insertion and deletion, along with its straightforward implementation, was a perfect match for the essential need for a substantial volume of real-time insertion and deletion, making it the ideal choice for the Warning feature.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code above shows basic examples of a list, but it can't handle the more complicated needs of my module. A circular doubly linked list would be a more suitable choice.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            A circular doubly linked list is somewhat similar to a regular doubly linked list. In a regular doubly linked list, each item knows what comes before and after it, which is useful for navigating back and forth in the list. Based on the requirements, if new warnings arise, they should be inserted at the front of the current warnings. When all the warnings have been displayed at least once, the looping begins. The placement of the warning insertion is crucial, as it can affect the order in which they are shown, especially during the looping of warnings.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            However, merely knowing the previous warnings is not sufficient. Based on the requirements, we need to continuously loop through the warnings, moving from the start of the list to the end and then starting over again. Therefore, a circular linked list is the solution. In a circular list, the last item points back to the first, creating a loop. This allows our warnings to cycle from the end back to the start of the list, which is exactly what we need.
        </p>

        <h2>Pros and Cons of Linked List: </h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dynamic size: Linked lists can adjust their size based on the number of elements, simplifying management of list with changing sizes.</li>
                <li>No memory waste: Linked lists do not allocate memory for unused elements, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.</li>
                <li>No overflow or underflow problems: As long as there's enough memory, there are no concerns about running out of space when using a linked list.</li>
                <li>Simple Implementation: Implementing a linked list is straightforward.</li>
                <li>Insertion and deletion is constant time: Updating the "next" pointer of the previous node for insertion and deletion is efficient.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Additional memory usage: Linked lists require extra memory to store pointers, and this overhead can become significant for large list.</li>
                <li>Less effective access: Accessing items from a linked list is slower compared to arrays, particularly for elements in the middle of the list.</li>
                <li>Complex search: Finding an element in a linked list takes up to O(n) time, making it suboptimal for search operations compared to arrays with O(1) access time.</li>
                <li>Slower Performance: Linked lists may have slower access speeds, especially for large list.</li>
                <li>Memory Overhead: Linked lists require additional memory to store pointers, which can be a drawback if memory usage is a concern.</li>
                <li>Lack of Random Access: Elements at a specific index cannot be directly accessed using linked lists, resulting in O(n) time for finding the nth element.</li>
                <li>Possible memory fragmentation: Over time, linked lists may experience memory fragmentation, potentially decreasing performance due to higher memory usage.</li>
            </ol>
